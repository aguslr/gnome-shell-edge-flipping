# GNOME Shell Edge-Flipping

## UPDATE

I am no longer using GNOME 3 so I have stopped developing this extension for now. However, a fellow coder, [Christian Schramm](https://github.com/Ed-von-Schleck) has decided to take up where I left so I recommend going to [his repository](https://github.com/Ed-von-Schleck/gnome-shell-edge-flipping) for more updates and instructions. Thanks.

## About

[GNOME Shell Edge-Flipping](http://aguslr.github.com/gnome-shell-edge-flipping/) is a [GNOME Shell extension](https://live.gnome.org/GnomeShell/Extensions) that provides reactive screen edges to switch between different workspaces, similar to what is provided by [Brightside](http://catmur.co.uk/brightside/), by some plugin in Compiz or natively in other Desktop Environments like Xfce. Here you can see a [video demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BSyOEjRyTc).
